# 0x08-Recursion

**This project focuses on solving different exercises using recursion. I have learnt and improved my skill in solving problems using recursion.**

## Helper File
[_putchar.c](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): Function that writes character to stdout.

## Header File
[main.h](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/main.h)_: Header file that contains prototypes of every function listed in the problems.
__The prototypes of every function is displayed below in table form__

### Function Prototypes
0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
[0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/0-puts_recursion.c): C function that prints string followed by a new line.

1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together 
[1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c): C function that prints string in reverse order.

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange 
[2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c): C function that returns length of string using recursion.

3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
[3-factorial.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/3-factorial.c):
C Function that returns factorial of a given number.

4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate 
[4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/4-pow_recursion.c): C function that returns the value of x raised to y.

5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer 
[5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c): C function that calculates square root of any number.

6. Inception. Is it possible? 
[6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c): C function that returns 1 if the input integer is a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), othe    rwise return 0.

7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything 
[100-is_palindrome.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/100-is_palindrome.c): C function that returns 1 if a string is palindrome or 0 if not.
