## C Files

0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee 
[0-create_array.c_](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/0-create_array.c):_Function that creates an array of chars and initializes it with specific char.

1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings 
[1-strdup.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/1-strdup.c)_:function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life 
[2-str_concat.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/2-str_concat.c):function that concatenates two strings.The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated.

3.  If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize 
[3-alloc_grid.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c): function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.The function should return NULL on failure.If width or height is 0 or negative, return NULL.

4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
[4-free_grid.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/4-free_grid.c):function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe
[100-argstostr.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/100-argstostr.c):function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.Returns NULL if ac == 0 or av == NULL.Returns a pointer to a new string, or NULL if it fails.
