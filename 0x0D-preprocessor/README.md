# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
In this project, I learned about common predefined macros in C while practicing implementing my own and include-guardingheader files.
## Files
0. Object-like Macro

	-[0-object_like_macro.h](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h): Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE`

1. Pi

	-[1-pi.h](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h): Header file that defines macro named `PI` as an abrevation for the token `3.14159265359`.

2. File Name

	-[2-main.c](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c): Program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

3. Function-like macro

	-[3-function_like_macro.h](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h): header function like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of number `x`.

4. SUM

	-[4-sum.h](https://github.com/Nathy-M/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h):a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
